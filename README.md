**Summary:** Psychology has traditionally been a laboratory discipline, focused on small-scale experiments conducted in person. However, recent technological innovations have made it possible to collect far more data from far more people than ever before.  In this talk, I will explore some of the consequences of being able to conduct psychological research at a larger scale, highlighting some of the tools that we have developed for doing so.  In particular, I will talk about using a platform for large-scale behavioral simulations to study collaborative memory, using convolutional neural networks to explore human categorization with naturalistic images, and using machine learning in conjunction with cognitive models to both predict and explain human decisions.

**Tom Griffiths** is the Henry R. Luce Professor of Information Technology, Consciousness and Culture in the Departments of Psychology and Computer Science at Princeton University. His research explores connections between human and machine learning, using ideas from statistics and artificial intelligence to understand how people solve the challenging computational problems they encounter in everyday life. Tom completed his PhD in Psychology at Stanford University in 2005, and taught at Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley before moving to Princeton. He has received awards for his research from organizations ranging from the American Psychological Association to the National Academy of Sciences, and is a co-author of the book _Algorithms to live by_, introducing ideas from computer science and cognitive science to a general audience.
